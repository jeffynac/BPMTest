  To configure BPWin to utilize this .wsc file for a job session where COM Serialization has been enabled, consult
  the COM Serialization topics in BPWin help, and specify this in the "Program" field of the serialization dialog:

     EssHost.exe -getobj"script:[path]"

  And replace the [path] portion with the path of the .wsc file.  For instance, if the path of this .wsc file is

     c:\EssScripts\Quick.wsc

  Then the entire contents of the "Program" field of the serialization dialog should look like this:

     EssHost.exe -getobj"script:c:\EssScripts\Quick.wsc"
